# ðŸŽ¯ Game: Hunt the King

## ðŸ§  Game Concept
Hunt the King is a two-player strategy game where each player places a King on a hidden board. Players take turns attacking coordinates to try to locate and "hit" the opponent's King.

---

## ðŸ“‹ Rules

1. Each player has a board (e.g., 8x8 grid).
2. Each player hides their King at a secret cell.
3. Random rocks are placed on the board at initialization to block cells.
4. Players take turns calling out a coordinate to attack.
5. The game evaluates the result of each attack:
   - `Hit`: The opponent's King is found.
   - `Miss`: Empty cell.
   - `Invalid`: Already attacked or a blocked cell.
6. The first to hit the opponent's King wins!
